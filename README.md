# LEVIN (Learning Enhanced Visualization Integrated with NLP)

  LEVIN is a Speech-to-Image Synthesis Model designed to simplify and enhance the teaching process. It works by taking speech inputs, converting them into text, and then using that text to fetch relevant images from a dataset. This makes it possible to automate the creation of visual aids based on spoken instructions, making learning more interactive and engaging. LEVIN aims to bridge the gap between verbal instructions and visual learning, offering a practical tool for educators and learners alike.
